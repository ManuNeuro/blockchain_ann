# Federated Blockchain System Overview

The Federated Blockchain System is a novel architecture that integrates the principles of Federated Learning (FL) with blockchain technology, while also leveraging concepts from Resource-Oriented Programming. This system aims to provide a privacy-preserving, secure, and decentralized environment for training and managing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

## System Components

- **Blockchain System**: Acts as the backbone, providing a secure and immutable ledger for all transactions and operations within the system.

- **Wallets**: Represent data storage entities for individual nodes (clients) in the network. Each wallet contains a localized dataset that is used for training the ANN models, thereby preserving data privacy.

- **ANN for Hashing**: Utilizes ANNs to generate hashes for data validation, ensuring data integrity and contributing to the security of the blockchain.

- **Transaction with AI Interaction**: Transactions in the system can include AI interactions, such as model updates or requests for model inference.

- **AI Interaction Contract**: Smart contracts that validate AI interactions, ensuring that only authenticated and approved operations are executed.

- **Mining Process**: Involves training ANNs which are integral to the mining process, securing the network, and validating transactions.

- **Mining Chain**: A specialized component of the blockchain that records and manages the mining process involving ANNs.

- **Dynamic NFT**: Non-Fungible Tokens that represent ownership of ANNs, including aggregated hash metadata for the models. These NFTs can dynamically update to reflect the latest state of the ANN.

- **Git Versioning**: A system akin to Git for tracking and managing versions of the AI models, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

- **Decentralized Hierarchy and Peer-to-Peer Governance**: Mechanisms for managing the decentralized network, including decision-making processes and updates to the system.

- **Manifest**: A document or ledger entry that details the creation and mining processes, providing transparency and verifiability.

## Federated Learning Workflow

- **Local Training**: Individual clients train local models on their private data without sharing it with the network.

- **Model Update**: Model updates, typically gradients or weights, are sent to the Aggregation Server, minimizing the exposure of private data.

- **Aggregation Server**: A central server that aggregates model updates from all clients to update the global model.

- **Global Model Distribution**: The updated global model is distributed back to the clients for further training, ensuring all nodes train on the most recent model version.

## Resource-Oriented Programming

- **Wallets as Resources**: Wallets are treated as resources with unique identifiers, storing data and model references.

- **Dynamic NFTs as Resources**: NFTs serve as dynamic resources that encapsulate the ownership and version history of ANNs.

- **Resource Versioning**: The Git Versioning system acts as a resource for tracking the evolution of ANNs, similar to tracking versions of software code.

## Decentralization and Security

- **Decentralized Training**: The training process is decentralized across multiple clients, enhancing security and resilience against attacks.

- **Security via Blockchain**: The blockchain ensures the security of transactions and model updates, providing an immutable record of all operations.

- **Smart Contracts**: AI Interaction Contracts and other smart contracts automate and secure AI-related transactions within the system.

## Conclusion

This Federated Blockchain System represents a forward-thinking approach to combining AI with blockchain technology.
